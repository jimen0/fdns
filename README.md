## fdns

[![pkg.go.dev reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/go.dev-reference-007d9c?logo=go&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jimen0/fdns)

Package **fdns** parses [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/) [Forward DNS](https://github.com/rapid7/sonar/wiki/Forward-DNS) dataset in a concurrent way. The parser reports found entries (subdomains, IP addresses, records, etc) for the given record and domain.

Behaviour has changed since the project was created. Now `A` record reports DNS names instead of IP addresses.

### Warnings

Please, remember that for old datasets, Rapid7 requires you to login before downloading them. This tool only aims to be used with the most recent release of them, therefore it doesn't support that logic. Feel free to submit a PR or fork the project if you need it.

### Test

Just run `go test -race -v ./...` inside of the project's root folder.

### Improvements

Submit a PR or open an issue. Just make sure that your PR passes `gofmt`, `golint` and `govet`.
